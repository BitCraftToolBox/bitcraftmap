## Roadmap

1 Finish the better coordinates system and clean up script
2 Finish the geojson sharing feature and release
3 make the higher resolution hexagon map with opencv and numpy (should be easy and high value)

## Wild ideas board

- Turn on / Turn off all waypoint
- Lazy loading of data
- Do everything for performace and ease of use
- New interface that follow bitcraft style
- Pathfinder using terrain elevation data
- Coordinates to biome calculator
- Rewrite to Typescript
- Query the database instead of getting data from bitjita
- Calculate walkable zones (ie where cart can go because there is no water)
- Do a community map instead of a spoiler map at launch
- When you search, searching doesnt search in other poi than claims (ruined cities, temple etc..) to fix

- Players data
    - Show player waystone
    - Show player missing waystones
    - Calculate player heat density zones
    - Show players on the map dynamically
    - See people exploration level in real time

- Market data
    - Show market data for each waypoints
    - Best prices for this market [1/5/10 percentile of prices]
    - Volume of the market calculated in number of orders, total buy order in hexcoins, other methods...

- Empires :
    - Show empire borders
    - Show watchtowers
    - More info about watchtowers (expiration / war...)

- Misc :
    - Show region names
    - Show regions grid
    - Show chunks grid


## Pass geoJson with the location.hash

- Possibles attacks : DOS (too many markers) / XSS / Unexpected behavior if malformed string
